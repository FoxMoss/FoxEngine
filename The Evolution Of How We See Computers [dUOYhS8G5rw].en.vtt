00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
In mid 1800s England, Charles Babbage&nbsp;
and Ada Lovelace created the ideas behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.640
modern computing. Ada saw the start of frontier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.600
of general purpose machines, automation&nbsp;
past a single task. This led to the rise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.100
of early computing and helped engineers&nbsp;
see greater purpose in their machines.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.980
The beginning of computing&nbsp;
normally starts in the 1640s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.500
when Blaise Pascal built his calculator in&nbsp;
France. Tired of the intensive mental work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.840
of doing taxes by hand, he created&nbsp;
a machine to automate the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.680
It was a bit more than the abacus of his&nbsp;
time, but it was a calculator and could help with some basic algebra,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.460
yet it was calculations were static and couldn't&nbsp;
adapt. The calculator must have worked well enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.640
as it was put through 50 revisions. This set&nbsp;
a bit of precedent when it came to automation:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:06.240
automate tasks with a machine specialized&nbsp;
for that task and only that task. That's the obvious solution.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.580
Jacquard furthered automation with Jacquard's&nbsp;
Loom in 1804. Joseph-Marie Jacquard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.640
automated the production of the aristocracy's&nbsp;
favored patterned cloth. He made a customizable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.160
machine, the pattern changed depending on what&nbsp;
holes had been punched into a wooden card.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:35.220
It caused the cost of high quality cloth to&nbsp;
plummet. The industrial revolution was one outcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.160
of this invention. You could make thousands of&nbsp;
cloth with different patterns in a single day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.060
with a single loom. Science and Industry Muesem&nbsp;
says "[Jacquard's Loom] made it possible for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.400
complex and detailed patterns to be manufactured&nbsp;
by unskilled workers in a fraction of the time".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.660
The machine was for a single task, it&nbsp;
adapted with no context of its own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:10.560
relying solely on the set of instructions given&nbsp;
to it for guidance. A simple dumb wood loom.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:20.940
Ada Byron was born in 1815, later renamed&nbsp;
Ada King, Countess of Lovelace. Ada was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.400
born the only legitimate child&nbsp;
of Lord Byron the *lordly* poet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.960
Due to her father's disposition, Ada's mother&nbsp;
tried to raise her as the opposite. Her childhood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.140
tended to lean towards the sciences and by&nbsp;
the time she met Babbage, he described her as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.540
"that Enchantress who has thrown her magical&nbsp;
spell around the most abstract of Sciences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.180
and has grasped it with a force which few&nbsp;
masculine intellects could have exerted over it" .

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.240
Charles Babbage was an English mathematician&nbsp;
and engineer. Who spent a large part of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.780
life trying to build and obtain&nbsp;
funding for a Difference Engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.280
It was designed to automate many&nbsp;
variations of the same equation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.176
something that only takes brute force to do.&nbsp;
It was still a very single-purpose machine&nbsp;like its predecessors

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.180
but it started to lay the groundwork in&nbsp;
Babbage's mind for a greater machine.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.780
Only bits of the Engine was built, you&nbsp;
could see how it could work. The government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.100
and most people of the time didn't see&nbsp;
the benefit of an expensive calculator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.306
when human labor could get the job done
for much cheaper.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.060
The 1840s brought a new Engine designed by&nbsp;
Babbage; The Analytical Engine. Ever iterating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.640
on the Difference Engine, he soon thought up&nbsp;
a way to forgo the limits of basic arithmetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.980
and instead be able to theoretically solve any&nbsp;
math problem, given you could lay out the steps to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:04.080
solving the problem. It was so ahead of its time&nbsp;
The Computer Museum says "The logical structure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.040
of the Analytical Engine was essentially the same&nbsp;
as that which has dominated computer design for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.160
electronic era". No previous work could even come&nbsp;
close to the engine, it was by itself part of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:25.680
frontier with no one in it. Yet the potential was&nbsp;
mostly unseen, "Surely if completed it would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.440
worthless as far as science is concerned?" states&nbsp;
Robert Peel the Prime Minister of England at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:40.320
time. Regardless a document was written up by the&nbsp;
future prime minister of Italy Luigi Menabrea in french. 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.660
This most would not&nbsp;see issue with,
except the British who wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:53.160
see how Babbage improved upon his previous Engine.&nbsp;
Ada King Countess of Lovelace was qualified for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:00.960
this job, she had the understanding of complex&nbsp;
math and French required for the job. This she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.020
took a year to do. Lady Lovelace did with&nbsp;
high proficiency. Not only just translating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.020
original document, but including a large number of&nbsp;
notes. These notes were bigger than the original&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.800
document. She saw more from the Analytical Engine&nbsp;
than most people at the time, thinking it could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.100
be used more generally. She claimed in note G,&nbsp;
that The Engine -and therefore all computers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.160
that worked similarly as The Engine- could not&nbsp;
create ideas of its own. The Engine was only as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.980
smart as its instructor, we'll come back to that.&nbsp;
Lovelace also attached a diagram that contained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.160
an algorithm to calculate a set of numbers, to do&nbsp;
this she created her own system of writing down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:54.300
programs, or what you need to tell the machine&nbsp;what
to do. A language for "programming" computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.660
Some might consider this one of the first&nbsp;
programming languages, an idea that would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:09.360
help later engineers map out their programs. She&nbsp;
 saw potential in the machine past just math,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.680
saying it could be used for composing music.&nbsp;
Unfortunately the Analytical Engine was never built.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.400
It wasn't until Harvard Mark 1 in the 1930s,&nbsp;
spearheaded by Howard Aiken that Babbage's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.600
ideas would start to be realized. Babbage's child&nbsp;
Henry Babbage sent Harvard the built parts of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.540
Difference Engine. As Aiken was looking through&nbsp;
the Harvard archives he found the received bits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:44.280
from Henry. While not directly credited for the&nbsp;
Mk. I, nor was the designs in any way based on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:51.420
the Engines, Babbage is said to be an interest of&nbsp;
Aiken. IBM claims "[The Mark 1] brought Babbage's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:58.740
principles of the analytical engine almost to&nbsp;
full realization, while adding important new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:06.900
features.". Its biggest achievement was bringing&nbsp;
these ideas to reality. A highly programmable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:15.060
calculating engine controlled like its predecessor&nbsp;
through punch cards. Still, its focus was math.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.240
The trend line was going up; computers could&nbsp;
do nothing (because they didn't exist). Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:28.440
it could, Hey! Actually, do something! It&nbsp;
wasn't quite expanding past math but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:34.260
was a starting point, and doing something&nbsp;
is more general than doing nothing. 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.860
Ada's programming notation from her original&nbsp;
translation was an idea that kept recurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.080
People started writing down the instructions&nbsp;
they needed to punch, making their job of keeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.760
track of the program easier. This notation&nbsp;
started to become more and more necessary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:58.200
as in the 1940s two new computing machines were&nbsp;
built, The ENAIC and The Manchester Baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:05.158
These machines started to become powerful enough&nbsp;
to run programs that run other programs. &nbsp;

00:08:05.378 --> 00:08:14.460
You could write a program in one notation, and have the&nbsp;
machine create another program it could run more&nbsp;easily. 

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:20.580
People were starting of thinking of doing&nbsp;
more with their computers. New notations would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:27.600
allow programmers to create notations that allowed&nbsp;
them to create more complex programs as well as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:34.980
condense the space needed to store programs. This&nbsp;
was also an expansion of the previously theorized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:41.940
sets of rules of Lambda Calculus by Alonzo&nbsp;
Church and Turing Machines by Alan Turing.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:49.164
Finally, Alan Turing made a note in a 1950 paper&nbsp;
pertaining to artificial intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.427 --> 00:08:55.500
He sees a point Ada Lovelace makes in her&nbsp;
translation; Lovelace claims computers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.120
in the way she understood them, could
 not create a new thoughts just based&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:07.380
on what it knew. Yet Turing saw more in the&nbsp;
cold electronics, saying "[if that is true then]

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.940
there is no virtue in the mere working out of&nbsp;
consequences from data and general principles.".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:22.080
We can look at data and form conclusions, is&nbsp;
that not thinking? The computer should not be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.660
limited to what the programmer was expecting&nbsp;
when writing a program nor when running a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:34.460
program, but the knowledge of anything it has&nbsp;
access to or is able to deduce from other information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.170
A machine that can be extended to the most niche&nbsp;
of use cases. 

00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:42.780
A truly general machine.
